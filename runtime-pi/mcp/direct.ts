/**
 * Direct MCP tool surface (the only LLM-facing surface).
 *
 * Registers `provider_call`, `run_history`, and `recall_memory` as
 * Pi-SDK tools, each forwarding to the sidecar's MCP `tools/call`
 * endpoint via {@link AppstrateMcpClient}. The LLM sees the canonical
 * MCP names verbatim — Appstrate is indistinguishable (LLM-side) from
 * any other MCP host.
 *
 * What this module deliberately does NOT do:
 *   - Sniff `tools/list` and re-derive the input schema. The schemas
 *     here are pinned to the sidecar's `mountMcp(...)` advertisement
 *     so a divergence between Pi tools and MCP tools is a one-line fix
 *     here, not silent re-validation drift.
 *   - Build the system prompt. We ship a 3-line capability prompt
 *     fragment via {@link DIRECT_TOOL_PROMPT}; the bundle owner
 *     decides whether to splice it in.
 *
 * The per-tool wiring (event emit → `mcp.callTool` → result-shape
 * adapter) lives in `@appstrate/runner-pi/runtime-tools/mcp-forward`,
 * symmetric with the bundle-driven `provider_call` factory in
 * `runner-pi/provider-bridge`. This file is orchestration-only.
