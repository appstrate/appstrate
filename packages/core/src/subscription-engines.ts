/**
 * Provider → execution-engine binding — the engine ROUTING CONTRACT.
 *
 * A model provider runs on one of three engines: the generic `pi` loop (every
 * API-key provider, and the default for anything unregistered), or a
 * subscription engine that drives a vendor's OFFICIAL binary so it signs its
 * own client fingerprint (no forging). What core owns here is the engine
 * VOCABULARY + the binding SHAPE — the `"claude"` engine, the binding
 * fields (credential-delivery mode, native-output capability, chat handler) +
 * the shared {@link ChatEngineInput} chat contract — and the pure
 * {@link isSubscriptionEngine} predicate. It ships ZERO bindings: the `claude`
 * (Claude Agent SDK) binding is contributed at boot by its opt-in provider
 * module (`@appstrate/module-claude-code`) via the `subscriptionEngine` field on
 * its {@link ModelProviderDefinition}.
 *
 * There is NO registry here anymore. The provider definition is the SINGLE
 * source of truth for a provider's engine; the platform's model-provider
 * registry (apps/api) exposes pure read helpers (`engineForProvider`,
 * `subscriptionEngineForProvider`, `providerHasNativeOutput`) that read those
 * definitions directly, so the run, chat, and llm-proxy surfaces agree without
 * a second copied map. (This is engine-routing vocabulary, NOT billing
 * vocabulary — no billing concept lives here.)
