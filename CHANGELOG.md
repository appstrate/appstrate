# Changelog

All notable changes to Appstrate will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Self-hosting closed mode (#228)** — env-driven invitation-only deployments.
  - `AUTH_DISABLE_SIGNUP=true` blocks new account creation; pending
    invitations and platform admins still pass through (resolves the
    Infisical-style "invitation breaks when signup is disabled" pitfall).
  - `AUTH_DISABLE_ORG_CREATION=true` restricts `POST /api/orgs` to
    platform admins; org-less users see a "Waiting for invitation" page.
  - `AUTH_PLATFORM_ADMIN_EMAILS` declarative allowlist (no UI, no
    migration, IaC-friendly).
  - `AUTH_ALLOWED_SIGNUP_DOMAINS` email-domain allowlist with invitation
    override for external contractors.
  - `AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_OWNER_EMAIL` (+ `AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_ORG_NAME`) auto-creates
    the root organization on first signup of the configured email.
  - `bun apps/api/scripts/bootstrap-org.ts --owner=… --name=…` for explicit
    ops bootstrap with idempotent JSON output.
  - `appstrate install` integration: interactive prompt asks for the
    bootstrap admin email (Tier ≥ 1, fresh installs only); non-interactive
    via `APPSTRATE_BOOTSTRAP_OWNER_EMAIL=… curl|bash` for IaC. When set,
    the closed-mode trio is written into the generated `.env`.
  - Post-install action note: when bootstrap is configured, the installer
    prints the exact `<APP_URL>/register` link the operator must open.
  - `RegisterPage` reads `AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_OWNER_EMAIL` from `__APP_CONFIG__`
    and pre-fills + locks the email field, plus a banner explaining why,
    so the operator only has to pick a password (typo-proof bootstrap).
  - After signup, the bootstrap owner is routed through the rest of
    onboarding (`/onboarding/create` auto-skips since the org already
    exists, landing on the model-config step) so they can configure
    their first model, providers, and invite teammates.
  - The display-name field is also pre-filled (still editable) by
    deriving a sensible name from the locked email
    (`john.doe@acme.com` → "John Doe"), so the operator only has to
    type a password to complete signup.
  - Full guide in `examples/self-hosting/AUTH_MODES.md`.
- Health check for main application container in Docker Compose
- Named Docker networks with data tier isolation (`appstrate-data`, `appstrate-public`)
- Shared `tsconfig.base.json` with strict settings across all packages
- `test` and `lint` tasks in Turborepo pipeline
- Root `bun test` script
- Explicit `exports` field in `@appstrate/connect` and `@appstrate/shared-types`
- RFC 9457 `errors[]` array populated on every 400 validation response so a
  single round-trip lists every problem (manifest, config, input, providers)
  instead of surfacing them one at a time.
- `POST /api/runs/inline/validate` runs preflight in `accumulate` mode,
  returning the full list of validation errors in one response.

### Changed

- Pinned Docker images to specific versions (postgres:16.8, redis:7.4, minio RELEASE.2025-03-12)
- Main Dockerfile now runs as non-root `bun` user in production
- ESLint `no-unused-vars` upgraded from `warn` to `error`
- All workspace packages extend shared `tsconfig.base.json`
- Enabled TypeScript type-checking on `runtime-pi` (previously disabled via `noCheck: true`)
- **BREAKING (API contract)**: `parseBody` helper — used by ~80 call sites
  across ~22 route files (core routes + `webhooks` and `oidc` modules) — now
  emits `code: "validation_failed"` instead of `code: "invalid_request"` on
  body-validation failures, and populates `errors[]` with every Zod issue
  instead of setting the top-level `param` field on the first one. Clients
  that branch on `code === "invalid_request"` or read `body.param` for
  body-validation errors must be updated to handle
  `code === "validation_failed"` and read the per-field `errors[]` array.
  Non-body validation errors (auth, app context, rate limits) continue to
  use their existing codes unchanged.
- **BREAKING (API contract)**: `validateAgentReadiness` now emits
  `code: "invalid_config"` for config-schema failures instead of the legacy
  `config_incomplete`, aligning with the inline-preflight stage that already
  used `invalid_config`. The field name and message are unchanged. Clients
  branching on `code === "config_incomplete"` must be updated.
- `validateAgentDependencies` parallelises provider checks via `Promise.all`
  across `isProviderEnabled`, `getProviderCredentialId`, and
  `getConnectionStatus`. The pre-existing check-type precedence (enabled →
  profile → credential → status → scope) is preserved; within each check
  type, the thrown error still follows `providers` iteration order. Happy-
  path latency is reduced.
- `ValidationFieldError` entries now carry an optional `title` (human-
  readable). Throwing wrappers (`validateAgentReadiness`,
  `validateAgentDependencies`, inline-preflight fail-fast) use it so the
  `Problem.title` field keeps its historical wording (e.g. "Empty Prompt")
  instead of surfacing the machine code.

### Removed

- Invalid `preserve-caught-error` ESLint rule

### Security

- Non-root container execution for main application image
- Network isolation between data services and public-facing services
