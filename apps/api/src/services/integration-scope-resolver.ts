/**
 * Phase 2 — OAuth scope inference for integration connect flows.
 *
 * `computeRequiredScopes` walks every agent installed in the application,
 * reads its `dependencies.integrations[id]` rich-form selection, and
 * unions the scopes contributed by each:
 *
 *   - `tools[]` declared by the agent → look up
 *     `integration.tools_policy[t].requiredScopes` (filtered by `requiredAuthKey`
 *     when multi-auth) and union them.
 *   - `scopes[]` declared by the agent → unioned as-is.
 *   - Agent declared the integration as a bare semver-range string (or
 *     rich form without `tools[]`) → contribute the union of *every*
 *     declared tool's `requiredScopes` for this auth (= "all tools
 *     allowed" default that mirrors Phase 3's runtime allowlist
 *     semantics).
 *
 * This is the floor every installed agent needs. It is NOT injected into
 * the connect kickoff — connecting requests the manifest defaults (plus
 * whatever the caller explicitly forwards), so a plain "connect" never
 * inherits unrelated agents' scopes. The union is consumed at refresh time
 * (`integration-credentials-resolver`) to detect when an IdP-side scope
 * shrink drops a connection below what the installed agents require, and
 * the agent surface uses the per-agent slice to drive an explicit upgrade.
 *
 * `getCurrentScopesGranted` reads the `scopesGranted` of one connection row
 * (the one being reconnected/upgraded) so the kickoff can keep re-consent a
 * strict superset of what that account already authorized.
 *
 * Both functions are read-only and safe to call from non-mutating routes.
