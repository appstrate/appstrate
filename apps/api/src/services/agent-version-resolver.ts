/**
 * Resolve which agent definition a run executes — the mutable draft or a
 * published `package_versions` snapshot (#636).
 *
 * Selector grammar (snake_case wire value of `?version=` on the run route
 * and `version_override` on schedules):
 *
 *   - `"draft"`     → execute the live draft (`packages.draft_manifest` /
 *                     `draft_content`) — the editor working copy.
 *   - `"published"` → execute the latest published version (the `latest`
 *                     dist-tag, falling back to the highest version id).
 *                     404 `no_published_version` when nothing is published.
 *   - anything else → 3-step resolution (exact version → dist-tag → semver
 *                     range) via {@link getVersionDetail}. 404 when nothing
 *                     matches.
 *   - omitted       → **strictly identical to `"published"`** (latest
 *                     published; 404 `no_published_version` when none). One
 *                     unified default for every caller — API / MCP / CLI /
 *                     schedule AND the dashboard transport: "run what was
 *                     published" is the least-surprising, reproducible default
 *                     for programmatic use. The working copy is NEVER an
 *                     implicit default: running it is opt-in via the explicit
 *                     `draft` selector (the editor UI passes it explicitly).
 *                     This keeps API and front coherent on every selector —
 *                     `draft` is the one editor-only capability, always
 *                     requested by name, never silently inferred.
 *
 * System agents have no published versions (their definition ships with the
 * platform), so any selector is ignored and the loaded definition runs as-is
 * — same behavior the route always had.
 *
 * When a published version is selected, the returned `overrideVersionLabel`
 * carries the concrete semver: `buildRunContext` persists it as the run's
 * `version_label` with `version_dirty: false`, and the run serializer derives
 * `version_ref` from that pair (see `deriveVersionRef` in state/runs.ts).
 *
 * Known scope limit (refs #588): substituting the published manifest + prompt
 * pins the agent definition itself, but skill dependencies still resolve
 * through `DraftPackageCatalog` on the run hot path — the org working-copy
 * model. Pinning the full transitive closure is the #588 follow-up.
